### Package-Latest

Package-Latest is a command line utility for Node.js projects that updates all dependency versions 
in your package.json file to the latest versions in the NPM registry. It will search for a package.json file in the current working directory. When updating, the tool will overwrite the package.json file in your current directory but will also save your previous version to a package_history directory.

### Install
	
	npm install -g package-latest

### Run

	package-latest
